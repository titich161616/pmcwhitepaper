# Community Governance

## How does it work?

In Wallet Memes, the governance that we want to build came naturally. We always have lots of meme coin projects approaching us, and we don't want to make the decision ourselves and be the one that says: "This project is good and this one is not." It needs to be done by the community, where they vote on the meme coin they think is valuable to them, so we don't have any bias. We delegate it to the community.

For any meme coin to be integrated into Memes Wallet, they're required to prepare a proposal, and then users who hold ($PMC + That project token) are able to vote on it. There's a threshold to be met, and then that project can be integrated.

This will also apply to any feature we want to add to the wallet. After we propose the feature, $PMC holders need to vote and approve the feature to be deployed.
