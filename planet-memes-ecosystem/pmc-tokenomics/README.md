### $PMC Holders Benefits&#x20;

Early Holders: 4% of the supply of $PMC will be distributed to meme coin holders (Meme coins selected by the DAO+ $PMC). 7% of these tokens will be released 7 days after the spanshot, while the remainder will be released linearly over the next 2 years. The snapshot will happen during the 10 days after the PMC mainnet launch.

Loyal Holders: 7% of the supply will be distributed as intermittent airdrops following right after the Early Holders airdrop, during a period of 5 years linear vesting.

The protocol will take intermittent snapshots of users' wallets every month (5–15 times) and make an average of their meme coin plus the minimum $PMC holdings.

So, instead of requiring users to stake tokens and locking them up, the protocol will take intermittent snapshots of users' wallet holdings (a random number of 5–15 each month). Then, it will distribute $PMC rewards following an average of these holdings over the past month on the 1st of the following month. Holders who sold more than 30% of their allocation will be disqualified from the airdrop, 50% of their allocation will be burned and the remainder will be added to the loyal holders; this protocol will encourage holding $PMC giving it long-term healthy growth.
