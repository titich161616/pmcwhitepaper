**Memesgress is a decentralized governance**

Memesgress is a platform dedicated to Planet Memes. It makes it easy for the Planet memes community to create and vote on proposals, not only with $PMG.

$PMG holders vote to accept/reject the proposed change. Under the governance contract, community members democratically vote on proposals that will advance the development of the PMC network. To be able to recommend a proposal, the user must have a sufficient number of $PMG token shares. On the other hand, people with a certain amount of $PMG tokens can vote on proposals.
