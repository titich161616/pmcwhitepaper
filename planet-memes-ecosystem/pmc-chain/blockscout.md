# Blockscout

### Overview

This guide goes into details on how to compile and deploy Blockscout instance to work with PMC-Chain. Blockscout has its own [documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/manual-deployment), but this guide focuses on simple but detailed step-by-step instructions on how to setup Blockscout instance.

### Environment

* Operating System: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS [download link](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) with sudo permissions
* Server Hardware: 8CPU / 16GB RAM / 50GB HDD (LVM)
* Database Server: Dedicated server with 2 CPU / 4GB RAM / 100GB SSD / PostgreSQL 13.4

#### DB Server

The requirement for following this guide is to have a database server ready, database and db user configured. This guide will not go into details on how to deploy and configure PostgreSQL server. There are plenty of guides on now to do this, for example [DigitalOcean Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart)

:::info DISCLAIMER This guide is meant only to help you to get Blockscout up and running on a single instance which is not ideal production setup.\
For production, you'll probably want to introduce reverse proxy, load balancer, scalability options, etc. into the architecture. :::

## Blockscout Deployment Procedure

### Part 1 - install dependencies

Before we start we need to make sure we have all the binaries installed that the blockscout is dependent on.

#### Update & upgrade system

```bash
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

#### Add erlang repos

```bash
# go to your home dir
cd ~
# download deb
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_2.0_all.deb
# download key
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/erlang_solutions.asc
# install repo
sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_2.0_all.deb
# install key
sudo apt-key add erlang_solutions.asc
# remove deb
rm erlang-solutions_2.0_all.deb
# remove key
rm erlang_solutions.asc
```

#### Add NodeJS repo

```bash
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```

#### Install Rust

```bash
sudo curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
```

#### Install required version of Erlang

```bash
sudo apt -y install esl-erlang=1:24.*
```

#### Install required version of Elixir

The version of Elixir must be `1.13`. If we try and install this version from the official repo, the `erlang` will update to `Erlang/OTP 25` and we do not want that.\
Because of this, we need to install the specific precompiled `elixir` version from GitHub releases page.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir /usr/local/elixir
wget https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/download/v1.13.4/Precompiled.zip
sudo unzip -d /usr/local/elixir/ Precompiled.zip
rm Precompiled.zip
```

Now we need to properly set up `exlixir` system binaries.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/elixir/bin/elixir /usr/local/bin/elixir
sudo ln -s /usr/local/elixir/bin/mix /usr/local/bin/mix
sudo ln -s /usr/local/elixir/bin/iex /usr/local/bin/iex
sudo ln -s /usr/local/elixir/bin/elixirc /usr/local/bin/elixirc
```

Check if `elixir` and `erlang` are properly installed by running `elixir -v`. This should be the output:

```bash
Erlang/OTP 24 [erts-12.3.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [jit]

Elixir 1.13.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 22)
```

:::warning `Erlang/OTP` must be version `24` and `Elixir` must be version `1.13.*`.\
If that is not the case, you will run into issues with compiling Blockscout and/or running it. :::\
:::info Check out the official [_**Blockscout requirements page**_](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/requirements) :::

#### Install NodeJS

```bash
sudo apt -y install nodejs
```

#### Install Cargo

```bash
sudo apt -y install cargo
```

#### Install other dependencies

```bash
sudo apt -y install automake libtool inotify-tools gcc libgmp-dev make g++ git
```

#### Optionally install postgresql client to check your db connection

```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client
```

### Part 2 - set environment variables

We need to set the environment variables, before we begin with Blockscout compilation. In this guide we'll set only the basic minimum to get it working. Full list of variables that can be set you can find [here](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/information-and-settings/env-variables)

#### Set database connection as environment variable

```bash
# postgresql connection example:  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://blockscout:Passw0Rd@db.instance.local:5432/blockscout
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<db_user>:<db_pass>@<db_host>:<db_port>/<db_name> # db_name does not have to be existing database

# we set these env vars to test the db connection with psql
export PGPASSWORD=Passw0Rd
export PGUSER=blockscout
export PGHOST=db.instance.local
export PGDATABASE=postgres # on AWS RDS postgres database is always created
```

Now test your DB connection with provided parameters. Since you've provided PG env vars, you should be able to connect to the database only by running:

```bash
psql
```

If the database is configured correctly, you should see a psql prompt:

```bash
psql (12.9 (Ubuntu 12.9-0ubuntu0.20.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

blockscout=>
```

Otherwise, you might see an error like this:

```bash
psql: error: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "blockscout"
FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "blockscout"
```

If this is the case [these docs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/databases-postgresql) might help you.

:::info DB Connection Make sure you've sorted out all db connection issues before proceeding to the next part. You'll need to provide superuser privileges to blockscout user. :::

```bash
postgres@ubuntu:~$ createuser --interactive
Enter name of role to add: blockscout
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
```

### Part 3 - clone and compile Blockscout

Now we finally get to start the Blockscout installation.

#### Clone Blockscout repo

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Trapesys/blockscout
```

#### Generate secret key base to protect production build

```bash
cd blockscout
mix deps.get
mix local.rebar --force
mix phx.gen.secret
```

At the very last line, you should see a long string of random characters.\
This should be set as your `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable, before the next step.\
For example:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY_BASE="912X3UlQ9p9yFEBD0JU+g27v43HLAYl38nQzJGvnQsir2pMlcGYtSeRY0sSdLkV/"
```

#### Set production mode

```bash
export MIX_ENV=prod
```

#### Compile

Cd into clone directory and start compiling

```bash
cd blockcout
mix local.hex --force
mix do deps.get, local.rebar --force, deps.compile, compile
```

:::info If you have deployed previously, remove static assets from the previous build _**mix phx.digest.clean**_. :::

#### Migrate databases

:::info This part will fail if you didn't set up your DB connection properly, you didn't provide, or you've defined wrong parameters at DATABASE\_URL environment variable. The database user needs to have superuser privileges. :::

```bash
mix do ecto.create, ecto.migrate
```

If you need to drop the database first, run

```bash
mix do ecto.drop, ecto.create, ecto.migrate
```

#### Install npm dependencies and compile frontend assets

You need to change directory to the folder which contains frontend assets.

```bash
cd apps/block_scout_web/assets
sudo npm install
sudo node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode production
```

:::info Be patient Compilation of these assets can take a few minutes, and it will display no output. It can look like the process is stuck, but just be patient. When compile process is finished, it should output something like: `webpack 5.69.1 compiled with 3 warnings in 104942 ms` :::

#### Build static assets

For this step you need to return to the root of your Blockscout clone folder.

```bash
cd ~/blockscout
sudo mix phx.digest
```

#### Generate self-signed certificates

:::info You can skip this step if you won't use `https`. :::

```bash
cd apps/block_scout_web
mix phx.gen.cert blockscout blockscout.local
```

### Part 4 - create and run Blockscout service

In this part we need to set up a system service as we want Blockscout to run in the background and persist after system reboot.

#### Create service file

```bash
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/explorer.service
```

#### Edit service file

Use your favorite linux text editor to edit this file and configure the service.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/explorer.service
```

The contents of the explorer.service file should look like this:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Blockscout Server
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=root
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/blockscout
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mix phx.server
EnvironmentFile=/usr/local/blockscout/env_vars.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Enable starting service on system boot

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable explorer.service
```

#### Move your Blockscout clone folder to system-wide location

Blockscout service needs to have access to the folder you've cloned from Blockscout repo and compiled all the assets.

```bash
sudo mv ~/blockscout /usr/local
```

#### Create env vars file which will be used by Blockscout service

```bash
sudo touch /usr/local/blockscout/env_vars.env
# use your favorite text editor
sudo vi /usr/local/blockscout/env_vars.env

# env_vars.env file should hold these values ( adjusted for your environment )
ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_HTTP_URL="localhost:8545"  # json-rpc API of the chain
ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_TRACE_URL="localhost:8545" # same as json-rpc API 
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://blockscout:Passw0Rd@db.instance.local:5432/blockscout' # database connection from Step 2
SECRET_KEY_BASE="912X3UlQ9p9yFEBD0JU+g27v43HLAYl38nQzJGvnQsir2pMlcGYtSeRY0sSdLkV/" # secret key base 
ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_WS_URL="ws://localhost:8545/ws" # websocket API of the chain
CHAIN_ID=93201 # chain id
HEART_COMMAND="systemctl restart explorer" # command used by blockscout to restart it self in case of failure
SUBNETWORK="Supertestnet POA" # this will be in html title
LOGO="/images/polygon_edge_logo.svg" # logo location
LOGO_FOOTER="/images/polygon_edge_logo.svg" # footer logo location
COIN="EDGE" # coin
COIN_NAME="EDGE Coin" # name of the coin
INDEXER_DISABLE_BLOCK_REWARD_FETCHER="true" # disable block reward indexer as PMC Chain doesn't support tracing
INDEXER_DISABLE_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS_FETCHER="true" # disable pending transactions indexer as PMC Chain doesn't support tracing
INDEXER_DISABLE_INTERNAL_TRANSACTIONS_FETCHER="true" # disable internal transactions indexer as PMC Chain doesn't support tracing
MIX_ENV="prod" # run in production mode
BLOCKSCOUT_PROTOCOL="http" # protocol to run blockscout web service on
PORT=4000 # port to run blockscout service on
DISABLE_EXCHANGE_RATES="true" # disable fetching of exchange rates
POOL_SIZE=200 # the number of database connections
POOL_SIZE_API=300 # the number of read-only database connections
ECTO_USE_SSL="false" # if protocol is set to http this should be false 
HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT=60 # run HEARTH_COMMAND if heartbeat missing for this amount of seconds
INDEXER_MEMORY_LIMIT="10Gb" # soft memory limit for indexer - depending on the size of the chain and the amount of RAM the server has
FETCH_REWARDS_WAY="manual" # disable trace_block query 
INDEXER_EMPTY_BLOCKS_SANITIZER_BATCH_SIZE=1000 # sanitize empty block in this batch size
```

:::info Use `SECRET_KEY_BASE` you've generated in Part 3. ::: Save the file and exit.

#### Finally, start Blockscout service

```bash
sudo systemctl start explorer.service
```

### Part 5 - test out the functionality of your Blockscout instance

Now all that's left to do is to check if Blockscout service is running. Check service status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status explorer.service
```

To check service output:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u explorer.service -f
```

You can check if there are some new listening ports:

```bash
# if netstat is not installed
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo netstat -tulpn
```

You should get a list of listening ports and on the list there should be something like this:

```
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5432            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      28142/postgres
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      42148/beam.smp
```

Blockscout web service runs the port and protocol defined in env file. In this example it runs on `4000`(http).\
If everything is ok, you should be able to access the Blockscout web portal with `http://<host_ip>:4000`.

### Considerations

For best performance, it is advisable to have a dedicated/local `PMC-Chain` full archive non-validator node that will be used exclusively for Blockscout queries.\
The `json-rpc` API of this node, doesn't need to be exposed publicly, as Blockscout runs all queries from the backend.

### Final thoughts

We've just deployed a single Blockscout instance, which works fine, but for production you should consider placing this instance behind a reverse proxy like Nginx. You should also think about database and instance scalability, depending on your use case.

You should definitely check out the official [Blockscout documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) as there a lot of customisation options.
