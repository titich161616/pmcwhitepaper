# Smart Contracts FAQ

### Does PMC Chain support Smart Contracts?

Yes. PMC Chain networks are Ethereum compatible blockchains, so Smart Contracts that are deployable on Ethereum, are also deployable on PMC Chain chains.

### Can you update the staking contract logic for PoS after deployment?

For now, after you have started the PoS network, you cannot change the staking contract logic, as it is part of the genesis file. So you cannot, for example, change the minimum/maximum number of validators. What you can do is stake or unstake, to add or remove validators.
