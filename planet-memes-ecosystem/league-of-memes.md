League of Memes is an exciting, cutting-edge blockchain game based entirely on-chain with no off-chain logic whatsoever. The entire game is decentralized and permissionless, creating a first-of-its-kind crypto game that will run autonomously with no assistance needed from the dev team. There are “nations” as they are called in the game — Doge Clan, Shiba Army, Floki Army, and more meme coins that will be selected by the DAO. Each nation is represented by a geographic location on the League of Memes map
