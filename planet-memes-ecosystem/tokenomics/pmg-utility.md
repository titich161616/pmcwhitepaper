## Governance

The PMG token provides its holders with voting rights when they lock up their tokens. The voting power of a holder depends on their lockup duration and the total number of tokens they have locked. Holders can vote on a variety of issues, such as choosing meme tokens to burn, allocating treasury resources, and proposing improvements to the protocol.

* 10% of revenue is allocated to buyback burns, and token holders have the power to vote on which meme coin to burn and the PMG/MC burn ratio.
