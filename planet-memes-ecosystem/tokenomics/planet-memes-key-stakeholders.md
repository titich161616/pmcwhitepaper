## Stakeholders Interactions And Value Flow

A relationship map is an important tool for understanding the balance between resource extraction and infusion. The map highlights extraction points in red and infusion points in green, making it easy to see how they are related.&#x20;

The objective is to ensure that for every extraction point, there is a sufficient infusion point that counteracts its effects and leads to net positive growth of resources. By mapping and analyzing these relationships, it is possible to make informed decisions about resource management and achieve a healthy balance between extraction and infusion.
