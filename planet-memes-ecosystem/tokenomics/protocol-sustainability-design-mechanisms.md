# Protocol Sustainability Design Mechanisms

## Sustainability Strategies

### Planet Meme Flywheel

To secure long-term survival for the Planet Meme ecosystem, we aim to enhance the health of $PMG as usage volume grows. This is accomplished through a self-sustaining mechanism, known as a flywheel.

The increased usage of the PMG protocols leads to an increase in social activities and captures more attention, fueling a higher desire to participate and generating greater demand for PMG (and partner tokens).

Additionally, increased usage also results in more revenue, which is allocated to:

#### Buyback and burn:&#x20;

Part of our revenue is used to buy back and burn PMG. This process reduces the supply of PMG, thereby increasing their value. The portion of revenue allocated to buybacks and burns is dynamic and expected to increase as the ecosystem scales. Thus creating more demand for the PMG and partner tokens over time.

#### DAO:

Funds are directed to the DAO, which then distributes them to workers through grant programs. These workers are tasked with expanding the Planet Meme ecosystem, thereby creating a continuous cycle of growth.

#### Community Grant Programs:

These programs provide rewards to network participants who contribute valuable work to the ecosystem. Funded by the DAO, these teams engage in a range of activities, such as enhancing core software, developing and enhancing complementary applications, outreach efforts, and community building.

### Low Entry Barrier

In addition to combining the seamless user experience of web2 with the technological and social advantages of web3, a low barrier to entry has been established to attract a large audience, thereby promoting the growth of the ecosystem.

### DAO Treasury

The revenue generated by the treasury ensures the financial stability of the protocol, providing sufficient funding for its continued development. This allows the protocol to pursue its goals and maintain its growth, without worrying about a lack of resources.
