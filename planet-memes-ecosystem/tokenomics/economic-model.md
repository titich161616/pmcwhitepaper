# Economic Model

Three main components power the Planet Meme economy: stablecoins, in-game hard currencies, and PMG (Planet Meme governance token).

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are used for various transactions within the Planet Meme economy, including purchasing all types of Planet Meme NFTs, competition tickets, and in-game currencies. Additionally, P2E rewards are paid out in stablecoins.

## In-game Hard Currencies

The virtual economy within our game is powered by off-chain tokens that exist only within the game. Each game in our ecosystem has its own unique hard currency, which can be acquired through various means, including purchasing with stablecoins or fiat using credit/debit cards. This enables Web2 users to play the game without having to interact with the complexities of a blockchain. Hard currencies can be earned as rewards for playing, and also used to purchase in-game items that enhance the player's experience, such as gems and potions.

## PMG

A maximum of 1 billion PMG (Planet Meme governance) tokens will be created. Out of the total supply, 20% will be made available to the community through various reward programs, while the remaining 80% will be allocated to game development, partnerships, and community incentives. There will be no private or public sale and no vested tokens. However, players who wish to participate in the governance mechanism of the protocol (e.g., voting on proposals such as which meme token to burn), and earn yield (from our revenue) may buy PMG from the treasury at a fixed price. There is no expectation of profit on PMG tokens as they are designed solely to help decentralize the protocol.
