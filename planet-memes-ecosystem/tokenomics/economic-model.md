# Economic Model

Three main components power the Planet Meme economy: stablecoins, in-game hard currencies, and PMG (Planet Meme governance token).

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are used for various transactions within the Planet Meme economy, including purchasing all types of Planet Meme NFTs, competition tickets, and in-game currencies. Additionally, P2E rewards are paid out in stablecoins.

## In-game Hard Currencies

The virtual economy within our game is powered by off-chain tokens that exist only within the game. Each game in our ecosystem has its own unique hard currency, which can be acquired through various means, including purchasing with stablecoins or fiat using credit/debit cards. This enables Web2 users to play the game without having to interact with the complexities of a blockchain. Hard currencies can be earned as rewards for playing, and also used to purchase in-game items that enhance the player's experience, such as gems and potions.

## PMG

A maximum of 1 billion PMG (Planet Meme Governance) tokens will be created. Of the total supply, 10% and 20% will be sold in a private and public round, respectively. While the remaining 70% will be allocated to game development, partnerships, and community incentives. These reserved tokens, except for the allocation for the Foundation, will be distributed over three years through a combination of airdrops and other community-oriented initiatives.
