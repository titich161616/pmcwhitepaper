# PMG Distribution

## Token Distribution Goals

To better understand the context of our token allocation, it is useful to enumerate the design objectives of our token distribution.

* A guiding principle of fairness to all stakeholders
* Aim for broadest distribution through token distribution events or bounties
* Incentivize network users and participants (gamers, NFT enthusiasts, partner communities)
* Reward believers in the utility value
* Ensure sufficient funds for Foundation to build a network, activate the ecosystem, and cover liabilities
* Ensure community and partners' comfort with token distribution for smooth provision of services on the network.

## Initial Supply Breakdown

| Allocation Type               | Supply |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Treasury (Network Operations) | 62%    |
| Foundation                    | 15%    |
| Rewards (Gameplay & Airdrop)  | 20%    |
| Advisors                      | 3%     |

### Treasury Allocation Breakdown

50% (310,000,000) of Treasury PMG tokens have been set aside for sale to users at a fixed price of 0.005, with each wallet being limited to a maximum purchase of 310,000 PMG. All revenue generated from the sale of these tokens will be directed to the Treasury. Where it is then used to cover various expenses, such as operational costs, grant programs, or liquidity rewards to bootstrap liquidity, should the DAO decide to launch a market for PMG.

### Reward Allocation Breakdown

PMG airdrops will be distributed to two groups of community participants: NFT holders and P2E gamers. This will include all game modes in the P2E versions of any Planet Memes game, with top tournament participants receiving a larger share of the reward tokens.
