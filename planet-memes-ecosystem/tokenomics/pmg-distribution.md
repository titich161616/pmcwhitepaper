# PMG Distribution

## Token Distribution Goals

To better understand the context of our token allocation, it is useful to enumerate the design objectives of our token distribution.

* A guiding principle of fairness to all stakeholders
* Aim for broadest distribution through token distribution events or bounties
* Incentivize network users and participants (gamers, NFT enthusiasts, partner communities)
* Reward believers in the utility value
* Ensure sufficient funds for Foundation to build a network, activate the ecosystem, and cover liabilities
* Ensure community and partners' comfort with token distribution for smooth provision of services on the network.
