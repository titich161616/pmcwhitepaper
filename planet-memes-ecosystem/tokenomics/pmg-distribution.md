# PMG Distribution

## Token Distribution Goals

To better understand the context of our token allocation, it is useful to enumerate the design objectives of our token distribution.

* A guiding principle of fairness to all stakeholders
* Aim for broadest distribution through token distribution events or bounties
* Incentivize network users and participants (gamers, NFT enthusiasts, partner communities)
* Reward believers in the utility value
* Ensure sufficient funds for Foundation to build a network, activate the ecosystem, and cover liabilities
* Ensure community and partners' comfort with token distribution for smooth provision of services on the network.

## Initial Supply Breakdown

### PMG

A maximum of 1 billion PMG (Planet Meme Governance) tokens will be created. Of the total supply, 10% and 20% will be sold in a private and public round, respectively. While the remaining 70% will be allocated to game development, partnerships, and community incentives. These reserved tokens, except for the allocation for the Foundation, will be distributed over three years through a combination of airdrops and other community-oriented initiatives.
