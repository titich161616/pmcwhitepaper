We are excited to introduce you to our first game, Clash of Memes, a real-time strategy game inspired by Clash Royale. This game delivers AAA-quality graphics and cutting-edge features and allows players to collect and upgrade cards featuring meme-themed characters and abilities, as well as spells and towers to defend their base. As players progress through the game, they can earn rewards in the form of meme rubies and other in-game items, and upgrade their cards and heroes, making it a true play-and-earn experience. These cards are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), giving them true ownership and value within the game.

In addition to Clash of Memes, we also offer casual games that allow players to earn PMC while joining daily challenges and tournaments.&#x20;
