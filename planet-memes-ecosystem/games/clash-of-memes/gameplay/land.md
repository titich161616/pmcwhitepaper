# Land

In addition to the NFT characters and items, players will also be able to collect and upgrade unique NFT lands in Clash of Memes. These NFT lands will serve as the battlegrounds where players can challenge each other and compete in battles. Each land will have its own unique features, such as terrain and obstacles, that will provide an added layer of strategy to gameplay.

Players will also have the ability to customize their lands and create their own tournaments with their own rules. This will allow for a more engaging and dynamic player-to-player experience. These NFT lands will also be minted on the PMC Chain and will be another way for players to own and control their in-game assets.

Players will also have the ability to monetize their lands by charging entry fees to the tournaments they host and by collecting the rewards from winning battles. This feature will add a new layer of economy to the game and provide players with an additional way to earn.

The NFT lands will be a key feature of Clash of Memes and we are excited to see the creative ways that players will use them to enhance their gaming experience. We will be providing more information on the NFT lands and tournaments in future updates.
