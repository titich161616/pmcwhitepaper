# Meme Coin Mania

In Meme coin mania, players take on the role of a group of meme coins stranded on Mars after their rocket ship was damaged by an asteroid. The goal of the game is to complete quests and collect resources to repair the rocket ship and continue the journey to the peaceful planet of Memes. Along the way, players can also compete against each other in PVP tournaments, using their collected resources to build and upgrade their own custom characters.



The game offers a unique and entertaining blend of match-3 gameplay with PVP competition and a storyline inspired by the world of meme coins. Players can also earn rewards in the form of in-game currency (PMC) meme coins and NFTs, which can be used to purchase items and upgrades to further customize their experience.

One of the key features of Meme Coin Mania is the ability to earn through gameplay. Players can earn tokens by completing levels, participating in tournaments, and by trading their NFTs on the marketplace.

The game also includes a social aspect where players can challenge each other, trade NFTs, and participate in tournaments to compete for prizes. This creates a competitive and engaging player-to-player experience.
