# Meme Coin Mania

Meme Coin Mania is an exciting match-3 game that takes inspiration from the popular title, Royal Match. In this game, players will match three or more objects of the same type to progress through the levels and earn rewards. But Meme Coin Mania isn't just any ordinary match-3 game - it features a robust economy built around the use of $PMC and Gems, as well as a thriving NFT ecosystem that provides unique and exclusive rewards for players. In this article, we will explore the different aspects of Meme Coin Mania's economy and how they incentivize players to engage with the game in new and exciting ways.



### Microtransactions

Players in Meme Coin Mania will be able to purchase all microtransactions with a credit card or $PMC at a 5% discount. The types of microtransactions available in the game include:

1. Direct purchase of Gold, the in-game currency
2. Direct purchase of Loot Boxes that contain gold, boosters, and power-ups
3. Direct purchase of the Battle Pass
4. Direct purchase of tickets for paid tournaments
5. And other special promotions

### Gems & Mania Pass

In Planet Memes, gems are a form of progression currency that are used to unlock new levels and progress through the game. Players can earn gems by completing game levels. Each level requires a certain number of gems to unlock, with the number increasing as the player progresses through the game. There are 50 levels, and each level unlocked by obtaining gems contains a specific reward that is either gold, boosters, power-ups, or a loot box that contains a variety of items.

Meme Coin Mania also has a monthly Battle Pass called “Mania Pass” that unlocks a second-tier progression alongside gems. For each gem level unlocked on the free tier, another level is also unlocked on the paid tier through the purchase of the Mania Pass.

If a player unlocks all 50 levels and holds the Mania Pass, they unlock the final progressive item called the “Meme Coin Bank.”

The Meme Coin Bank holds 2.5% of all microtransactions within Meme Coin Mania. Over the remainder of the 30 days, players will continue to accrue gems. At the end of the 30 days, the $PMC held within the bank will be claimable by the player pro rata the number of gems they hold in this final progression.

### $PMC Rewards

Meme Coin Mania offers several avenues for players to earn $PMC rewards. These avenues are designed to align with web2 motivations and utilize game theory methods to motivate players. 10% of all $PMC microtransactions go towards $PMC rewards, while 10% of credit card purchases are used to buy back $PMC and be utilized for microtransactions done by credit card.

The first avenue for $PMC rewards is through leaderboards. Weekly and monthly leaderboards of 100 players each will offer the top three players in each group with $PMC rewards, sourced from 2.5% of all microtransactions. This incentivizes players to compete for the top spots on the leaderboard and strive for excellence in their gameplay. The leaderboard rewards will also include team leaderboards, not just single players, adding a team element and promoting cooperative play.

The second avenue for $PMC rewards is through tournaments and competitions. Paid battles and tournaments will be available to players, offering $PMC rewards to winners. Like the leaderboards, these rewards are sourced from 2.5% of all microtransactions. This avenue motivates competitive play and encourages players to invest in improving their skills and strategies to win.

The third avenue for $PMC rewards is the Meme Coin Bank. The Meme Coin Bank is the final progressive item in the Mania Pass and holds 2.5% of all microtransactions within Meme Coin Mania. Over the remainder of the 30 days, players will continue to accrue gems. At the end of the 30 days, the $PMC held within the bank will be claimable by the player pro rata the number of gems they hold in this final progression. This motivates fast progression within 30 days as well as the purchase of the Mania Pass, which unlocks the second-tier progression alongside gems.

The fourth avenue for $PMC rewards is through end game progression. Once players complete all 50 levels, they will enter the end game progression phase. The specifics of the end game progression are still being developed, but it will utilize game theory methods to incentivize players to pay to progress faster and receive the highest rewards within the end game. This avenue aims to motivate players to continue playing and investing in the game even after completing all levels.

Overall, the $PMC rewards in Meme Coin Mania are designed to align with web2 motivations and utilize game theory methods to motivate players to invest in their gameplay and strive for excellence. These rewards provide a tangible value to players and demonstrate the potential of web3 token economy designs to revolutionize the gaming industry.

### NFT Ecosystem

In addition to its use of $PMC and Gems, Meme Coin Mania also features a robust NFT ecosystem that provides unique and exclusive rewards for players. In this section, we will explore the different types of NFTs available within the game and how they fit into the overall economic framework of Meme Coin Mania. We will also discuss the motivations behind the creation of these NFTs and how they incentivize players to engage with the game in new and exciting ways.

Meme Coin Mania's NFT ecosystem offers a variety of rewards for players, including cosmetics, game specific NFTs, and the Genesis Collection. Gold, boosters, power-ups, and loot boxes earned within the two-tier progression will not be NFTs, as we want to avoid competition between the company's revenue and the secondary marketplace. The mania pass will also not be an NFT, as it is intended to be purchased exclusively from us.

Cosmetics will be one of the main types of NFTs available in the game. These NFTs will be available for purchase or can be exclusively earned within the game. However, these cosmetics will be rare, making them highly valuable and sought after by players. The game specific NFT will offer all the features of the monthly in-game Mania Pass, as well as exclusive discounts on microtransactions and a range of in-game UI upgrades such as enhanced animations and designs.

The Genesis Collection will feature a factory building that is fully related to Meme Coin Mania. This factory will produce Luxury NFT loot boxes, NFT cosmetics, and non-NFT in-game items such as loot boxes and cosmetics. The factory can be upgraded by a combination of paying and staking $PMC, which will increase the chance of higher rarity items and NFTs. These Genesis NFTs will be highly coveted, as they will be the rarest and most exclusive NFTs within the game.

The creation of these NFTs serves to incentivize players to engage with the game and its ecosystem in new and exciting ways. The rarity and exclusivity of these NFTs will motivate players to collect and trade them, further driving engagement within the game. The NFT ecosystem also provides a new revenue stream for the company, allowing for the continued development and growth of Meme Coin Mania.
