# Economic Personas

Planet Memes is designed to accommodate a wide range of player types, each with their own unique motivations, behaviors, and goals. These player personas have been identified through extensive research and analysis of player behavior in similar games and will be crucial in shaping the game's economy and monetization strategies. From free-to-play players to web3 whales, each player persona has different preferences and needs, and the game's design will aim to provide a tailored experience for each one. In this section, we will explore the five player personas and how Planet Memes will cater to their needs.

### Free-to-Play (F2P) Players:

Free-to-Play (F2P) Players: These players rely solely on earning in-game rewards through basic activities such as completing missions and quests. They do not spend any money in the game, but they can still earn $PMC by landing on top spots of the leaderboard or by being among the most progressed pack of players. As they do not spend real money in the game, F2P players are incentivized by the satisfaction of progressing through the game and achieving in-game goals. They may also be interested in participating in the game's social aspects, such as forming alliances or competing with other players. Due to their limited access to rewards, F2P players may take longer to progress through the game compared to paying players, but they can still achieve high rankings and earn valuable rewards with dedication and skill.

### Casual Spenders:

Casual spenders are players who are willing to spend a moderate amount of money on microtransactions to enhance their gaming experience or progress more quickly. This persona is motivated by the desire for in-game benefits and will make occasional purchases to improve their performance. They may also be attracted to exclusive cosmetic NFTs that can be purchased with $PMC. Casual spenders will be incentivized to spend by limited-time offers and sales, as well as exclusive benefits for using $PMC for purchases. Additionally, they may have the opportunity to earn $PMC rewards by participating in timed leaderboards or end-of-season rewards for ranked gameplay. The rewards for this persona will be designed to provide an enhanced gaming experience without requiring a significant financial investment.

### Web2 Whales:

Web2 Whales are players who spend a significant amount of money on microtransactions in the game, often using credit cards for payment. They value their in-game experience and are willing to invest real money to achieve their desired level of progress. In order to further incentivize these players and convert them into Web3 users or whales, we will offer exclusive benefits to those who use $PMC to purchase in-game items, such as a 5% discount on all microtransactions. Additionally, we will highlight paid battles and tournaments that offer $PMC rewards which can be sold or reinvested into the game. Our goal is to encourage these players to learn about the potential benefits of Web3 by offering them exclusive rewards that can only be obtained using $PMC or through the NFT ecosystem. By consistently topping leaderboards and earning exclusive NFTs that can be sold on secondary marketplaces for $PMC, Web2 Whales will have an added incentive to invest in the use of $PMC and NFTs, ultimately leading to a conversion into Web3 users or whales.

### Web3 Users

Web3 Users are players who use $PMC to purchase microtransactions in the game, often attracted by the discounted prices offered for using the token. They understand the value of the token and the benefits of using it within the game, such as lower costs and exclusive rewards. Additionally, they are drawn to the exclusive benefits of the Genesis NFT Collection and game-specific NFTs, which enhance their gameplay experience and serve as a form of investment. Web3 Users are incentivized by the discounted prices offered for using $PMC to purchase microtransactions in the game, as well as the exclusive benefits and rewards that come with using the token. As they continue to use $PMC and collect NFTs, they will become more familiar with web3 technology and may eventually become Web3 Whales.

### Web3 Whales

Web3 Whales are high-spending players who see the value in $PMC and the NFT ecosystem, and invest significant amounts of money into the game to maximize their in-game benefits and earn valuable NFTs. They are motivated by the potential for significant returns on their investment, both through in-game rewards and secondary market sales of NFTs. Web3 Whales are likely to purchase multiple Genesis NFTs, as well as farm game-specific NFT collections and upgrade their land and buildings to the maximum level. They are key players in driving the economy of the game, as they create a demand for $PMC and NFTs through their high volume of transactions.
