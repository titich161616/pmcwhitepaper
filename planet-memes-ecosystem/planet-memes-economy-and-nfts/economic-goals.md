# Economic Goals

### ECONOMIC GOALS

Planet Memes is more than just a gaming platform. It is an ecosystem designed to create a sustainable and balanced economy that benefits all stakeholders, from players to developers and investors. To achieve this goal, Planet Memes has set several objectives that guide its design and operation. These objectives include maintaining a stable and predictable in-game economy, properly incentivizing different actors through sophisticated game theory techniques, facilitating engagement and monetization for players across various tiers, and creating a robust ecosystem that accommodates different player personas. By pursuing these goals, Planet Memes aims to establish a long-lasting and successful gaming platform that delivers a rewarding and enjoyable experience to all its users.

### Sustainable Economy:&#x20;

The goal of the global ecosystem is to create a sustainable and self-sufficient economy that benefits all players and stakeholders. To achieve this, we have designed the economy to be self-regulating, with supply and demand mechanisms that ensure stability and prevent inflation. Additionally, we have incorporated mechanisms to prevent hoarding and promote the circulation of $PMC and other tokens throughout the ecosystem.

We also aim to create an economy that is fair and equitable for all participants, regardless of their financial means or skill level. By providing multiple tiers of participation and incentivizing engagement, we aim to create an ecosystem that is accessible and enjoyable for all players. Ultimately, our goal is to build a strong and resilient economy that can continue to thrive and grow over time, providing long-term value to all stakeholders.

### Balanced In-game Economy:

In order to maintain an in-game stable economy, all microtransactions within the Planet Memes platform will be pegged to the USD value and will not be tied to fluctuating assets. This will create a stable internal economy that is not subject to sudden fluctuations in value that could destabilize the platform. By ensuring a stable in-game economy, players can confidently engage with the platform without fear of sudden market volatility affecting their experience. Additionally, this stability allows for a predictable and sustainable system for in-game monetization, which benefits both the players and the platform's long-term viability.

To further ensure the stability of the in-game economy, we have designed a system that keeps the items that are intended to be speculated on outside of the stable game environment. For instance, the Genesis NFT collection, $PMC, Cosmetic NFTs, and Game Specific NFTs, among others, will be excluded from the stable game economy. By doing so, we ensure that what needs to be stable remains stable while also allowing for investment pieces and luxury items to be speculated upon in peer-to-peer markets. This system strikes a balance between stability and opportunity, creating a sustainable ecosystem that is beneficial for all players involved.

### Sophisticated Incentivization Design:

One of the primary goals of Planet Memes is to create a sophisticated incentivization design that properly motivates different actors within the ecosystem. Using game theory techniques and careful consideration of short-term, mid-term, and long-term incentives, we aim to create an environment that is both engaging and sustainable. Our goal is not to create new motivations or conflicting incentives that may hinder or ultimately destroy the gameplay experience. Instead, we want to enhance the existing motivations and create a rewarding and fulfilling experience for all players.

To accomplish this, we have designed a comprehensive system that rewards players for their engagement and progression within the game. By placing incentives at key points in the game and creating a clear path for advancement, we aim to motivate players to continue playing and investing in their experience. This includes short-term rewards, mid-term rewards, and long-term/end-game rewards for achieving significant time dependent milestones. Through this approach, we can create a sustainable ecosystem that encourages continued engagement and provides value to all players, regardless of their level of investment.



### Facilitate all player personas:

Planet Memes has been designed to accommodate a wide range of users, from those who prefer to play for free to those who are willing to spend significant amounts of money on the game. There are five distinct personas within the game's economy:

1. Free to Play - offering access to the game without the need for any monetary investment.
2. Casual Spenders - those who are willing to spend small amounts of money on microtransactions, such as loot boxes and power-ups.
3. Web2 Whales - players who are willing to spend large amounts of money on microtransactions, typically using credit cards to make purchases.
4. Web3 Users - players who prefer to use $PMC to make microtransactions, taking advantage of the 5% discount available to them.
5. Web3 Whales - players who want a luxury NFT experience and are willing to spend large amounts of $PMC to achieve it.

By providing options for users across different personas and incentivizing their participation, Planet Memes aims to create an inclusive and sustainable gaming ecosystem that can accommodate players of all levels and preferences.
