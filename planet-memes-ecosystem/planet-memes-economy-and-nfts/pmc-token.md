# PMC Token

Planet Memes introduces its native token, PMC, as the backbone of the platform's token economy. PMC provides its users with a variety of utilities that include microtransactions, exclusive cosmetics, paid battles and tournaments, NFT land upgrades, and access to the NFT secondary marketplace. The token can also be held and staked for rewards in multiple staking pools, including the Loot Box Staking Pool, Dynamic Staking Pool, and NFT Land Upgrades. PMC can be earned through progression rewards, leaderboard rewards, tournament and paid battle rewards, as well as staking rewards. This economy is designed to create sustainable token circulation that incentivizes both player progression and investor activity.

### Microtransactions

Microtransactions are a significant part of the PMC token economy. Players can purchase in-game items, services, and access to exclusive content through microtransactions. The revenue generated through these purchases is carefully distributed among various channels to ensure long-term sustainability and stability of the economy.

### Staking pools

Planet Memes offers two token staking pools for users to earn rewards by staking their $PMC tokens. These staking pools incentivize users to hold and stake their tokens for a longer period, contributing to the overall stability of the $PMC token economy.

### Dynamic Staking Pool

The Dynamic Staking Pool was designed to reward users for holding and staking their tokens, with the APY being dynamic based on the number of tokens staked. A portion of all microtransaction purchases will be funneled into this staking pool, and rewards will be initially sourced from microtransactions only. This was designed to ensure that even if all staked tokens were sold as rewards, it would not have a net sell pressure on the token in the eyes of the liquidity pool. We plan to cap these rewards at 5% of all microtransaction purchases to ensure a sustainable model for the ecosystem. This staking pool incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens, while also providing a steady stream of rewards for the ecosystem.



### NFT Lootbox Staking Pool

The NFT lootbox staking pool incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens for longer periods of time while providing a unique and exciting reward system for $PMC token holders. Inspired by the Gacha Box method, users can stake their tokens in exchange for monthly lootbox rewards, with the strength of the lootbox dependent on the length and time spent staked at that moment. While not all rewards will be NFTs, longer staking periods increase the chances of receiving valuable NFTs that can be used or sold on secondary markets for $PMC.
