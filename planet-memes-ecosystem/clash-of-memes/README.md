## Game Overview

\
\
Clash of Memes is an exciting, cutting-edge blockchain Card game game based entirely on-chain with no off-chain logic whatsoever. The entire game is decentralized and permissionless, creating a first-of-its-kind crypto game that will run autonomously without needing assistance from the dev team. There are "nations" as they are called in the game â€” Doge Clan, Shiba Army, Floki Army, and more meme coins that the DAO will select. Each nation is represented by a geographic location on the League of Memes map\


Card games usually have a strategy and action gameplay along with a custom card system. In this game, we want to define crypto coins as cards(3d characters) with a special feature, a buff effect, and some cost, which will be fully explained in the gameplay section. All features will be defined based on the main crypto market. Look at this game as a strategy war for traders.The design of the overall theme of the gameplay will be very similar to clash royale and clash of clans, with the difference that players must upgrade for attack and defense at the same time.

### Main target

Strategy balance :Designing the balance of the strategy will be one of our challenges in this project. In the gameplay of this game, we see that the player must protect his tower and also destroy the opponent's tower. So we have to adjust the strategy so that the loser does not leave the game. And to be eager to play again. For this purpose, we consider a growth system based on the player's ability (rank), whose increase or decrease will give rewards or new forces for the game, and also give the player a goal in the game.
