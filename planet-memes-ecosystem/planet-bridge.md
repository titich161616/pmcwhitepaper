# PlanetBridge

PlanetBridge is a modular multi-directional blockchain bridge supporting EVM and Substrate compatible chains built by ChainSafe. It allows users to transfer all kinds of assets or messages between two different chains.

A bridge contract (or pallet in Substrate) on each chain forms either side of a bridge. Handler contracts allow for customizable behavior upon receiving transactions to and from the bridge. For example, locking up an asset on one side and minting a new one on the other. It's highly customizable - you can deploy a handler contract to perform any action you like.
